                 joined. I honestly feel I got every penny's worth.</p>   
                 <p class="p1">"I was EMT for many years bevore i joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and 
                    have heard some people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro and found it incredebly 
                    fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best-and most grueling-timeof my life. 
                    Since completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup"</p>

                    The program gave me the confidence necessary to be able to go out in the world and ppresent myself as a 
                    capable junior developer. The standart is above the rest. You will get the personal attention you nedd from an

                <p class="p5">"Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from 
                    professionals who can help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a forer student 
                    of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. 
                    They were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular,
                     was outstanding. It took my learning to the next lever in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, 
                     I've often referrred to it during interviews as an example of my developent and experience. It certainly helped me 
                     land a job as a full-stack developer after recieving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"</p>
